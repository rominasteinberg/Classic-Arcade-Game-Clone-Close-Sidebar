## Instructions to open the game

To play the game, you must use the following commands:
-> Key up to advance towards the river;
-> Key down to return;
-> Key right to go to the right;
-> Key left to move to the left.

## Goal of the game 

The main goal of the game is to reach the other side of the road, the river.

To do this, you have to dodge enemies. Each bug moves at different speeds and should not be touched from any angle.

> Every time you get to the river you gain a life.
> Every time a bug hits you, you lose a life.

In both cases you return to the exit point.

You start with 3 lives, if you get to 0, you lose the game and start again.

Good luck!
